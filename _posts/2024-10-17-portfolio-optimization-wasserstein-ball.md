title: "Wasserstein Ball Portfolio Optimization"

In this post, I summarize my implementation of portfolio optimization within a Wasserstein ball. 

**Main ideas**:
- Robust optimization approach
- Wasserstein distance as a measure of distributional robustness
- Mathematical model

Check out the full implementation [here](https://github.com/your-username/wasserstein-portfolio-optimization).
